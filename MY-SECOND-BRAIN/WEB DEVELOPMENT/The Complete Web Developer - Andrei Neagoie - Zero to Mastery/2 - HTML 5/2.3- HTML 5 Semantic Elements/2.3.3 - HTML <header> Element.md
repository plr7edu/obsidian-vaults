# HTML `<header>` Element

The `<header>` element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A `<header>` element typically contains:

-  one or more heading elements (`<h1> - <h6>`)
-  logo or icon
-  authorship information

**Note:** You can have several `<header>` elements in one HTML document. However, `<header>` cannot be placed within a `<footer>`, `<address>` or another `<header>` element.
