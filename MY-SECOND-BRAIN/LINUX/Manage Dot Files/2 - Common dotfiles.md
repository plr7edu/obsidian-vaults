- On Linux and macOS there are certain dot files you will commonly See : -

| ~/.bash_profile | A script loaded<br> when you login in              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ~/.bashrc       | A script loaded<br> when you open terminal         |
| ~/.emacs.d      | Emacs<br> Configuration                            |
| ~/.vimrc        | Vim Configuration                                  |
| ~/.gitconfig    | Configuration for<br> Git                          |
| ~/.config       | A folder full of<br> many more configuration files |


They are not common in Windows but many cross-platform programs will store dot-configuration files in "==C:\Users\username== or ==C:\Users\username\Appdata\Roaming=="
