## Overview (Gnome) : -

- [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) is arguably the most popular desktop environment out there.

- Many of the popular Linux distros use GNOME as their default desktop environment and it has some popular forks, such as [Cinnamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_%28software%29).

- GNOME is designed to be easy to use and customizable.

- The user interface aims to provide a unique experience (kind of tailored for both mobile and desktops).

- Unfortunately, GNOME isn’t a lightweight desktop environment.

- So, it’s not a great choice to go with if you are looking to install a Linux distribution on older computers or systems with less than 4 Gigs of RAM.

- It’s good to see that GNOME is also focusing on the performance side of things with their recent [GNOME 3.36 release](https://itsfoss.com/gnome-3-36-release/).

- So, if you want a good user experience with something that looks different from the likes of a traditional Windows layout, GNOME should be the perfect pick.

- Some major distros using GNOME are [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Not to forget [Pop OS 20.04](https://itsfoss.com/pop-os-20-04-review/) also features many good things along with GNOME desktop environment.

### Pros : -

-   Modern and touch-friendly UI
-   Can extend functionalities through [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://itsfoss.com/gnome-shell-extensions/)
-   Customizable

### Cons : -

-   Not suitable for older computers
-   User Interface isn’t tailored for a Windows user
