- Sometimes typing commands can get really repetitive, or if you need to type a long command many times, itâ€™s best to have an alias you can use for that.

- To create an alias for a command you simply specify an alias name and set it to the command.

### `$ alias foobar='ls -la'`

- Now instead of typing ls -la, you can type foobar and it will execute that command, pretty neat stuff.

- Keep in mind that this command won't save your alias after reboot, so you'll need to add a permanent alias in :-

### `~/.bashrc`  or similar files if you want to have it persist after reboot.`

### Remove aliases : -

- You can remove aliases with the unalias command

### `$ unalias foobar`
