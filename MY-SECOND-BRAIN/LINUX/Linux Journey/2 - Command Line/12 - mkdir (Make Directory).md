-   We’re gonna need some directories to store all these files we’ve been working on.
-   The mkdir command (Make Directory) is useful for that, it will create a directory if it doesn’t already exist.
-   You can even make multiple directories at the same time.

### `$ mkdir books paintings`

### Create Subdirectories

You can also create subdirectories at the same time with the  <mark>-p</mark> (parent flag).

### `$ mkdir -p books/hemmingway/favorites`
