## What are Footnote ?

- Footnotes are great if you want to add something to your notes without breaking the flow of your writing.
- Footnotes are **notes indicated in your text with numbers and placed at the bottom of the page**.
- An additional piece of information printed at the bottom of a page.

# Ted Talks are dangerously eloquent

^926ed6

Or, as [[Hamlet]] would say, “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”.

A perfect example is the talk called “How to sound smart in your TEDx Talk”. [^2]

Eloquent talks trick us into thinking we learn more than we actually do.

They make us feel good without really improving us. [^1]

You can also insert footnotes directly into text like so: 

```
This is some text. Some More text
This text has a foot note ^[Foot Note Text]
```

This text has a foot note ^[Foot Note Text]

**Tip:** 

I’d highly recommend the plugin: “Footnote Shortcut” if you are going to be using
footnotes on a regular basis.
