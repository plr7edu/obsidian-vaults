# Ted Talks are dangerously eloquent

^926ed6

Or, as [[Hamlet]] would say, “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”.

A perfect example is the talk called “How to sound smart in your TEDx Talk”. [^2]

Eloquent talks trick us into thinking we learn more than we actually do.

They make us feel good without really improving us. [^1]

**Tip:** 

I’d highly recommend the plugin: “Footnote Shortcut” if you are going to be using
footnotes on a regular basis.
