There are several ways to include attachments in your notes:

1.  Copy and paste;
2.  Drag and drop;
3.  Download or copy file to vault folder.

After being added, these attachment files are just normal files and can still be accessed through your file system.

- You can embed media in your Obsidian documents. 
- You’ll need to make sure that the media exists in the vault folder first. 
- Many people like to create an attachments folder and keep all their media there.
- Once you’ve put your media in the obsidian folder you can link to it like this:


```
![[picture.jpg]]
```

Here is a list of file types you can embed in obsidian:

1.  Markdown files: `md`;
2.  Image files: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `bmp`, `svg`;
3.  Audio files: `mp3`, `webm`, `wav`, `m4a`, `ogg`, `3gp`, `flac`;
4.  Video files: `mp4`, `webm`, `ogv`;
5.  PDF files: `pdf`.

- You can also just drag an image or supported file into your note and it’ll automatically embed it and put the file in your “attachments” folder. 

- Your attachments folder is just your vault by default but I would recommend making a separate folder for this so your vault doesn’t get too cluttered.
