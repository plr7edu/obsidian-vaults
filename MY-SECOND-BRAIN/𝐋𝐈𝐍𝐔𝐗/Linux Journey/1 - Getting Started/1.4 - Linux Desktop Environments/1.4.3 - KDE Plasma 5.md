- KDE is one of the most popular desktop environments out there.

- You may also refer it as the “Plasma” desktop.

- Yes, it looks like [KDE has managed to beat XFCE as one of the lightest desktop environments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/10/23/bold-prediction-kde-will-steal-the-lightweight-linux-desktop-crown-in-2020/#5562672f26d2).

- Not just limited to Jason’s test, you will find numerous benchmark comparisons and tests that point to the same result.

- KDE also makes it easier to connect your phone with your Linux system using [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/).
