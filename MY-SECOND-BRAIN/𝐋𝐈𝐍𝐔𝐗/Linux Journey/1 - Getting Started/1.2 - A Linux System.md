- A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

1. <mark>Hardware</mark>

	This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.

2. <mark>Linux Kernel</mark>

	The kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.

3. <mark>User Space</mark>

	This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.
