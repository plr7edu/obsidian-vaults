## Overview (Arch) :- 

- Arch is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution driven 100% by the community.

- Similar to Debian, Arch uses a rolling release model so incremental updates eventually become the Stable release. 

-  You really need to get your hands dirty to understand the system and its functions, but in turn you get complete and total control of your system.

## Configurability : - 

- If you want a lightweight operating system and really want to understand Linux use Arch!

- There’s a bit of a learning curve, but for the hardcore Linux users, this is a great choice.

## Uses : - 

- Great for desktop and laptop. If you also have a small device such as a Raspberry Pi and need to stick a lightweight OS on it, you can’t go wrong with Arch.
