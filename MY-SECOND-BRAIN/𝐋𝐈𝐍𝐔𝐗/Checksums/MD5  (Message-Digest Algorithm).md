- The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a cryptographically broken but still widely used [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) producing a 128-[bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) hash value.

- Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.

- It can still be used as a [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) to verify [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity),
