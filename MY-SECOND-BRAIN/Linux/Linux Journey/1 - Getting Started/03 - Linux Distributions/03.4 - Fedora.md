## Overview (Fedora) :- 

- Backed by Red Hat, the Fedora Project is community driven containing open-source and free software.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches off Fedora, so think of Fedora as an upstream RHEL operating system.
- Eventually RHEL will get updates from Fedora after thorough testing and quality assurance.
- Think of Fedora as an Ubuntu equivalent that uses a Red Hat backend instead of Debian.
