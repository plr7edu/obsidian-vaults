## Overview (XFCE) : -

- [Xfce](https://xfce.org/) is one of the most lightweight desktop environments out there.

- Unlike LXQt, you will find a lot of major Linux distributions support XFCE editions.

- Xfce is light on resources but proves to provide a feature-rich user experience.

- If you need a performance-centric desktop environment without needing advanced customizations, Xfce is a great choice to go with.

- To give you an example, I’d recommend you check out our initial impressions on [Zorin OS 15 Lite](https://itsfoss.com/zorin-os-lite/) which includes Xfce desktop environment as the default.

- Major Linux distributions like [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/), [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/), [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/), [Zorin OS Lite](https://zorinos.com/download/15/lite/), and several others feature Xfce as the default desktop environment.

### Pros : -

-   Lightweight and adaptable to old hardware
