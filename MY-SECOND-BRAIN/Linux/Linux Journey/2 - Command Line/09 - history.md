In your shell, there is a history of the commands that you previously entered, you can actually look through these commands.

This is quite useful when you want to find and run a command you used previously without actually typing it again.

### `$ history`

<mark>Want to run the same command you did before, just hit the up arrow.</mark>

- Want to run the previous command without typing it again?

- Use !!. If you typed cat log.txt and want to run it again, you can actually just go !! and it will run the last command you ran.

- Another history shortcut is ctrl-R, this is the reverse search command, if you hit ctrl-R and you start typing parts of the command you want it will show you matches and you can just navigate through them by hitting the ctrl-R key again.

- Once you found the command you want to use again, just hit the Enter key.

## <u>Tab Key in Command Line</u>

- one of the most useful features in any command-line environment is tab completion.

- If you start typing the beginning of a command, file, directory, etc and hit the Tab key, it will autocomplete based on what it finds in the directory you are searching as long as you donâ€™t have any other files that start with those letters.

- For example if you were trying to run the command chrome, you can type chr and press Tab and it will autocomplete chrome.
