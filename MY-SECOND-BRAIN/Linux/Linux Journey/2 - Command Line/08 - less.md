- If you are viewing text files larger than a simple output, less is more.

- (There is actually a command called more that does something similar, so this is ironic.)

- The text is displayed in a paged manner, so you can navigate through a text file page by page.

- Once you’re in the less command, you can actually use other keyboard commands to navigate in the file.

### `$ less /home/pete/Documents/text1`
