- SHA-1 is a hash algorithm discovered by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

- It is also known as the secured hash algorithm and it normally belongs to a family of cryptographic hash functions.

- It is a one-way hash function that has the ability to process a message with a maximum length of   264 – to 2128 – bits to produce a 160- to 512-bit condensed representation.

- However, SHA-1 uses a 160-bit hash function for checksum calculator which is ideal for verification of file integrity.

- The hash function tends to be similar to that of MD5 though this one is more secured.
